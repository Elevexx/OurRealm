# OurRealm — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Mission
Premium social platform with multi-mode UI, widget profiles, unified messaging, Sounds library, Polls, personalization, Home Dashboard, and Admin analytics.

## Tech Stack
React 19 · FastAPI · MongoDB (Motor) · Supabase (Postgres + Realtime for messaging only) · Mutagen · pgeocode.

## Architecture: dual-store
| Domain | Storage |
|---|---|
| Users, auth (JWT), profiles, widgets, friends, posts (+polls), comments, likes, notifications, images, tracks, track_likes, preferences, dashboards, ZIP/radius | MongoDB |
| Chats, Groups, Realms, Messages | Supabase Postgres + Realtime |

## Completed Phases
Phase 1 · 2 · 2.5 · 3 · 4A · 4A follow-up · 4B (Polls/Personalization) · 4B follow-up (Made for You) · Landing/Modes refresh · PWA icon · mode animations · Phase 5 foundation (Home Dashboard + Admin Analytics + PWA prompt + autoplay) · **Phase 5 MVP + deferred polish (Feb 2026)** · **Phase 5+ Parts 0/1/2/3 (Feb 2026)**.

## Phase 5+ — Launch Fixes (Feb 2026)

### Routing
- **Bottom nav**: `Home` → `/home` (HomeDashboard widgets), `Discover` → `/discover`, `For You` → `/feed` (was previously routing Home → /feed).
- **New signup**: `SignUp.jsx` now routes to `/interests` after registration.
- **Interest picker** is now reachable at both `/interests` (canonical) and `/home/legacy` (back-compat).
- **Feed → Customize Feed** button now routes to `/interests` (was `/home`).
- **Widget save sync**: `HomeDashboard.save()` now uses the server-cleaned response (`PUT /api/dashboard/layout` echoes `widgets`) so local + server state can't diverge — fixes the "widgets no longer customizable after save" symptom.

### Mobile post-management menu
- `components/PostManagementMenu.jsx` now renders as a **centered bottom sheet** under 640px:
  - 2×2 visibility grid (Public / Friends Only / Custom / Stealth)
  - Delete in its own destructive section below, separated by a top divider
  - `max-width: calc(100vw - 32px)`, `max-height: 80vh`, `paddingBottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`
  - Backdrop tap closes (`{tid}-backdrop`)
- Desktop (≥640px) retains the right-anchored popover unchanged.
- Permission gating preserved: owners see grid + Delete; `@stealth` on others' posts sees Delete only; everyone else sees nothing.

### Profile picture upload
- New `components/AvatarPicker.jsx` — modal with two tabs:
  - **Upload Photo** → `POST /api/images/upload` (CDN-rehosted, respects daily limits)
  - **Post Image URL** → `POST /api/images/from-url` (server fetches + rehosts)
- Persists via `PATCH /api/profile/me { avatar_url }` and calls `refreshMe()` so the avatar updates everywhere (posts, comments, friend lists, messages, notifications) via the global user state.
- Profile page (in edit mode) shows a **Camera** overlay if `avatar_url` is set, a **Plus** icon otherwise.

### Test coverage
- Backend 14/14 pytest pass · Frontend 13/13 Playwright assertions pass · zero defects.
- New regression suite: `/app/backend/tests/test_launch_fixes.py`. Report: `/app/test_reports/iteration_13.json`.

### Messaging restoration
- **Root cause of missing chats**: `pages/Messages.jsx` `ChatsTab` was querying ONLY the Supabase `chats` table; the 9 historical conversations in MongoDB `db.messages` were invisible.
- **Fix**: `ChatsTab` now calls `GET /api/messages/threads` (MongoDB-backed) for the 1:1 list. New `DMConversationOverlay` component renders the conversation using REST endpoints (`/thread/{username}`, `POST /messages`, `PATCH /messages/{id}`, `DELETE /messages/{id}`, `POST /messages/{id}/read`) — restoring Edit, Delete, Cancel, Delivered, and Read receipts. Polling every 4s flips Delivered → Read without a refresh.
- Groups + Realms continue to use the Supabase `ConversationOverlay`.

### Mobile modal layout
- **Root cause**: Both overlays used `w-full h-[80vh]` + `items-end sm:items-center` + `pb-24`, which clipped under the iOS status bar/home indicator and overflowed horizontally on narrow Android viewports.
- **Fix**: Both overlays now use `width: min(100vw - 24px, 640px)` + `max-height: calc(100dvh - env(safe-area-inset-top) - env(safe-area-inset-bottom) - 24px)` with `paddingTop/Bottom: max(12px, env(safe-area-inset-*))` on the backdrop. Verified at 375×800 and 360×780.

### Post management controls (NEW)
- `routers/posts.py`: new `PATCH /api/posts/{id}` (owner-only `visibility` + `custom_user_ids`) and `DELETE /api/posts/{id}` (owner OR `@stealth`). `_normalize_visibility` maps the public `"stealth"` label to the existing stored `"private"` (same owner-only semantic).
- `/api/posts` list endpoint now applies `_visibility_query` directly in the Mongo query — defense-in-depth so private posts never travel over the wire even if a client calls the raw endpoint.
- `components/PostManagementMenu.jsx`: inline action row mounted in Feed cards (`FeedCard` header) and MyFeedWidget rows (top-right). Owner sees `Public / Friends Only / Custom (FriendMultiPicker) / Stealth / Delete`. `@stealth` viewing another user's post sees `Delete` only. Everyone else: nothing rendered.

### Test coverage
- 16/16 backend pytest cases pass (`backend/tests/test_messaging_and_post_mgmt.py`).
- 18/18 frontend UI assertions pass across 3 user roles and mobile + desktop viewports.
- Report: `/app/test_reports/iteration_12.json`.

### Part 1 — Mode descriptions refreshed
`/modes` cards now ship the official taglines and body copy for Neon, Business, Millennium, Stealth. Rendered at `data-testid="modes-description-{mode}"`.

### Part 2 — Top 8 quick action + picker search
- Every friend card on `/friends` shows `friend-add-top8-{username}` (or `friend-in-top8-{username}` when already in slots).
- Hitting the cap returns the exact message **"Please remove friend from top 8 to add more"**.
- Picker modals on both `Friends.jsx` (`inner8-picker-search`) and `Top8Editor.jsx` (`top8-picker-search`) now expose a client-side filter on display name + `@username`.

### Part 3 — Role-based post character limits
| Role          | Limit |
|---------------|-------|
| Founder (`@stealth` / `is_founder`) | 2,000 |
| VIP (`is_vip`)                       |   500 |
| Default                              |   300 |

- Backend: `services/post_limits.py` — `character_limit_for(user)`, `enforce_post_content_limit(user, content)`. Wired into `POST /api/posts`.
- Frontend: `lib/postLimits.js` — `getPostCharacterLimit(user)`. Feed composer shows live counter `data-testid="feed-composer-charcount"` and disables `feed-composer-submit` when over.
- `PostCreate.content` Pydantic `max_length=2000` is the absolute hard ceiling (= founder cap); a comment in `schemas.py` notes the cross-file dependency.

### Part 0 — Polish
- **A** (core social polish) – no functional regressions; `refreshMe()` is called after Top-8 mutation so the Friends UI updates without a manual reload.
- **B** (Top 8 + widget persistence) – preserved; `inner_8` and `dashboard.widgets` still persist via existing endpoints.
- **C** (mode visual enhancements, CSS-only) – additive keyframes appended to `index.css`:
  - Neon: `neon-glow-pulse` on `.or-surface` + `neon-particle-drift` on the existing star field.
  - Business: `biz-sheen-pulse` on `.or-surface`.
  - Millennium: `millen-chrome-shine` on `.or-btn::before` + body-level `millen-star-twinkle` overlay (pointer-events: none).
  - Stealth: `stealth-pulse-ring` on `.or-btn::after`.
  - `prefers-reduced-motion` disables all animations.
- **D** (drag-to-resize widgets) – `HomeDashboard.jsx` SE-corner handle (`widget-{id}-resize`) uses pointer events + `SIZE_DIM` table to cycle through `sm → md → lg → xl`, persisted via existing `PUT /api/dashboard/layout`. `lg`/`xl` widgets get `gridColumn: span 2`.

## Phase 5 — Media Upload Limits (already shipped earlier this session)
- Server caps via `services/upload_limits.py` (3 MB / 20 per day for images, 5 MB / 10 / 60 s for audio, 10 MB / 3 / 30 s for video) with `@stealth` exempt.
- `GET /api/upload-limits/me` exposed and consumed by ImageUploadPicker + SoundUploadPicker.

## ⚠️ Backlog
1. Real weather + news API integration for dashboard widgets.
2. Advanced message status (Sent/Delivered/Read) — Supabase messenger.
3. Group/Realm member directory UI enhancements.
4. Real Wallet integration (currently mocked).
5. Dedicated "Manage Top 8" button on `/friends` for picker discoverability (suggested by tester).

## Test Credentials
See `/app/memory/test_credentials.md`. Note: `core/seed.py` backfills `is_vip=true` for all pre-existing users on every boot, so freshly-registered accounts are the only path to exercise the pure 300 default cap end-to-end.
